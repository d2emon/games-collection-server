  /*
   * about			Thing
   * 	The subject matter of the content.
   * 	Inverse property: subjectOf.
   * associatedMedia		MediaObject
   * 	A media object that encodes this CreativeWork.
   * 	This property is a synonym for encoding.
   * character			Person
   * 	Fictional person connected with a creative work.
   * contentLocation		Place
   * 	The location depicted or described in the content. For example, the
   * 	location in a photograph or painting.
   * contentRating		Text
   *    Official rating of a piece of contentâ€”for example,'MPAA PG-13'.
   * contentReferenceTime	DateTime
   *    The specific time described by a creative work, for works (e.g.
   *    articles, video objects etc.) that emphasise a particular moment
   *    within an Event.
   * contributor		Organization/Person
   * 	A secondary contributor to the CreativeWork or Event.
   * discussionUrl		URL
   * 	A link to the page containing the comments of the CreativeWork.
   * editor			Person
   *  	Specifies the Person who edited the CreativeWork.
   * fileFormat			Text  or URL
   * 	Media type, typically MIME format (see IANA site) of the content e.g.
   * 	application/zip of a SoftwareApplication binary. In cases where a
   * 	CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be
   * 	used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat
   * 	information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated
   * 	instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a
   * 	Wikipedia entry.
   * isBasedOn			CreativeWork  or Product or URL
   * 	A  resource that was used in the creation of this resource. This term
   * 	can be repeated for multiple sources.
   * 	For example, http://example.com/great-multiplication-intro.html.
   * 	Supersedes isBasedOnUrl.
   * isPartOf			CreativeWork
   * 	Indicates a CreativeWork that this CreativeWork is (in some sense)
   * 	part of.
   * 	Inverse property: hasPart.
   * license			CreativeWork  or URL
   * 	A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated
   * 	by URL.
   * locationCreated		Place
   * 	The location where the CreativeWork was created, which may not be the
   * 	same as the location depicted in the CreativeWork.
   * mainEntity			Thing
   * 	Indicates the primary entity described in some page or other
   * 	CreativeWork.
   * 	Inverse property: mainEntityOfPage.
   * position			Integer  or Text
   *  	The position of an item in a series or sequence of items.
   * publication		PublicationEvent
   * 	A publication event associated with the item.
   * temporalCoverage		DateTime  or Text  or URL
   * 	The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the
   * 	content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as
   * 	a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval
   * 	format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the
   * 	relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census
   * 	dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of
   * 	content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may
   * 	indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via
   * 	well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise
   * 	temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated
   * 	in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".
   * 	Supersedes datasetTimeInterval, temporal.
   * translator			Organization  or Person
   * 	Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different
   * 	languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target
   * 	market, or that translates during some event.

   * video			VideoObject
   * 	An embedded video object.
