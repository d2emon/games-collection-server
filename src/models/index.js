   * 	content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as
   * 	a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval
   * 	format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the
   * 	relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census
   * 	dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of
   * 	content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may
   * 	indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via
   * 	well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise
   * 	temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated
